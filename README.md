# ethereumj-android

This project is an Android-friendly redistribution of [ether.camp's](http://ether.camp) ethereumj. It depends on [SpongyCastle](https://rtyley.github.io/spongycastle/) to provide a comprehensive security implementation suitable for generating Ethereum-compatible private keys.

## Notes

* Shouldn't ethereumj have been named jthereum? :thinking:
